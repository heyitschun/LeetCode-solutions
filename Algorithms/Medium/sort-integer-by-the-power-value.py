"""
The power of an integer `x` is defined as the number of steps needed to
transform `x` into `1` using the following steps:

- if x is even then x = x / 2
- if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1

Given three integers, lo, hi and k, the task is to sort all integers in the 
interval [lo, hi] by the power value in ascending order, if two or more
intergers have the same power value sort them by ascending order.

Return the kth integer in the range sorted by the power value.

Example
-------

lo = 12
hi = 15
k = 2

>>> 13
"""

def getKth(lo, hi, k):
    return 

lo = 12
hi = 15
k = 2
